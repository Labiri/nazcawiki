## Creating an account on Binance

Creating and funding a Binance account is very easy. Go to Binance.com and click on the `Register` button.

_You can register with our referral link if you wish to support our work_

**Make sure you actually are on the Binance website (and not on a phishing website) by checking the SSL certificate's validity next to the address bar.**


2. Complete the registration form and open the registration email Binance will send you to activate your account. Once validated, it is strongly recommended to add Two Factor Authentication _(the process is very similar to Coinbase's one we covered in the "Purchasing cryptocurrencies" section of this guide)_


3. Verify your identity by following the instructions:

It may take up to a day or two to be verified, so don't worry if it doesn't happen immediately.


## Adding funds to your account
Go to `Funds -> Deposits` and select the coin\token you would like to send to your Binance account. For example, if you purchased Bitcoin on Coinbase, select "BTC - Bitcoin".

Click on `Copy Address`. This will be the destination address to use when sending your funds:

Go back on Coinbase and send your funds over:

The transaction will now need to be confirmed by the network. You can refresh the Binance page to see the status of the transaction.
