## Where to start?
For ease of purchasing we recommend Coinbase, and this is a quick tutorial to buy your first cryptocurrencies in order to fund your Binance account.

Note: This guide has been adapted from MrCryptoDude's tutorial posted on Reddit. The complete original version can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoinBase/comments/8deqla/coinbase_tutorial_a_definitive_guide_for_newcomers/).

## What is Coinbase?
[Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/) is a cryptocurrency trading platform which allows you to buy and sell four different cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum, and Litecoin. Note that there are over thousands of different cryptocurrencies but these four are what Coinbase specializes in. Of course, more cryptocurrencies may be added in the future and much speculation goes on about which cryptocurrencies will be added next; but that’s not very important into what we’ll be discussing.

## Making a Coinbase account
Creating a Coinbase account is very simple. Be sure to have either your driver’s license, passport, or identification card at hand as you’ll be asked to provide this information via upload.
### Why does Coinbase need to see my ID?
Coinbase needs to be able to verify your identify because they are a regulated financial service company operating in the US. As they state on their website:

_As a regulated financial service company operating in the US we are periodically required to identify users on our platform. This ensures we remain in compliance with KYC/AML laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate, something that is necessary for us to be able to continue to offer digital currency exchange services to our customers._

Once you’ve created your account, you’ll have to wait until you get approved before you’re allowed to start buying and trading on the platform. This can take upwards of 7 days till approval. Coinbase will also make two distinct small charges towards your bank account. You will need to find these charges and register them into Coinbase as a part of the approval process.

The time in which it’ll take to get approved will vary person to person, just be patient and you eventually will get approved. In the mean-time I highly recommend taking some extra steps done to ensure the security, and longevity of your account.

## Securing Your Coinbase Account
### Two Factor Authentication
Upon signing into your Coinbase account, you’ll be sent a text message containing a code in which you will have to input allowing you to access your account. This is a security measure done to ensure it is specifically you trying to access your account, it’s important to note that a hacker could still compromise your account through a social engineering attack with what is known as a phone porting attack. This attack is done after obtaining your phone number and various other personal information, the hacker will then call up your phone carrier impersonating you, and then attempt to port your number over to a new device. Once a hacker has access to your text messages, they can then access your account with your SMS two-factor authentication code.

Anyways, the best way to prevent this is through the use of an authenticator. The most common being [Google Authenticator](https://i.imgur.com/UIl4opo.png). I don’t want to get into too much technical details as to how authenticators work. Think of it as a digital key, stored on a device that changes every 30 seconds.

In order to enable authenticator for Coinbase, go to `Settings > Security` and `Enable Authenticator`:

After that a prompt will appear along with a QR code and a secret code (comprised of a random string of 16 letters & numbers). ![auth](https://i.imgur.com/AYqQCrH.png)

You will need to open up your Google Authenticator app and scan in your QR code. You will also need to **write down your secret code** and keep it in a safe place such as a safe and/or security deposit box.

Once enabled, any time you wish to access your Coinbase account or make trades/transfers, you will need access to the 6-digit code provided by your authenticator.

Attention: If you lose access to the device you’ve enacted authenticator on, you ABSOLUTELY WILL NOT be able to recover your account UNLESS you have that 16 digit secret code. This is a serious matter that should be taken with serious caution. It is important you take preventative security measures to ensure the security of your cryptocurrency. I highly recommend calling your bank and opening a security deposit box. This will mostly likely cost a yearly fee but the peace of mind alone is worth it.

## Funding Your Coinbase Account
![buy_coinbase](https://i.imgur.com/isNuaSJ.png) Congratulations, your Coinbase account got approved! You can now start funding your account… or so you thought.

Upon your first cryptocurrency purchase with Coinbase, it is very likely your bank will automatically flag the purchase as fraudulent. If this happens to you (which it most likely will), you will need to call up your bank and let them know to let the purchase go through.

Once you’ve taken care of that, buying and selling cryptocurrency is relatively self-explanatory. Just go to `Buy/Sell` in the menu and choose which currency you’d like to buy/sell:

## Sending cryptocurrencies
Go to Accounts in the menu, look for the currency you’d like to send, then click `Send`. A prompt will come up instructing you to put in the recipients address and the amount you’d like to send. Ethereum example:

You are now ready to send them to your Binance account. If you don't have an account yet, check the section [Registering a Binance account](binance.md) of this guide.
